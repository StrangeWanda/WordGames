A simple program to solve the question "how many words can you make from the letters of a given word"


The Word_subset.py file lists all meaningfull words that can be formed by a given word.
On the other hand MeansInWord.py file lists the words posible along with their meanings.

Note that both programs consider 'single letter words' to be valid words.Some accronyoms are also considerd words.
*This will be fixed in the future*
